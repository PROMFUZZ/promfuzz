Typical steps in a price manipulation attack include: borrowing a substantial amount of tokens using mechanisms like flash loans, disrupting the token pair's exchange rate in an Automated Market Maker (AMM), executing token swaps through the manipulation of application contracts with the AMM, and finally, re-establishing the exchange rate equilibrium of the token pair in the AMM to secure a profit.
